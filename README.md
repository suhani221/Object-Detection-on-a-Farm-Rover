# Object-Detection-on-a-Farm-Rover

This project uses data collected by an agricultural robot developed
at the University of Bonn. This robot was fitted with a camera and RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue, and Depth) sensor to image the plants on the field (and many other sensors to track its position).The camera recorded both RGB images and near infrared (NIR) emission.The complete dataset is very large. We will work with imaging data from only one session of the robotâ€™s trips.

In this project we successfully implement an algorithm which can distinguish between grassroot plant and grasses by using K-means clustering.
